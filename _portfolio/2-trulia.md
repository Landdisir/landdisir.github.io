## Explanation

After learning about Flexbox and putting applying it, we furthered our learning by copying Trulia's website design. 

## Problem

As the number of mobile users grow, websites that previously worked great are no longer able to adequately serve the mobile market.

## Solution

By applying a mobile-first mentality to website design with responsive positioning, websites like Trulia's have responsive design and positioning that allow them to cater to both markets without issue. 

## Codepen

All of the work was done of codepen and can be viewed here.
