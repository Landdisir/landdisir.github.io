## Explanation

After jumping into the HTML and CSS, we quickly ran into our first main tool to create responsive and dynamic layouts - Flexbox

## Problem

Modern web design is requires more responsiveness than the websites of old. CSS was originaly designed to mimic a newspaper layout with no concern for interactive websites. 
As a result, for years, front end design was a maze of floats and clears.

## Solution

Flexbox allows for users to avoid floats and create custom, responsive designs for their websites that work for the modern multi-device internet user.

## Codepen

All of the work was done of codepen and can be viewed here.
