## Explanation

The modern website boasts not only responsive design and responsive positioning, but also interactive UI components that allow for a more seamless user experience. 


## Problem

HTML and CSS are limited with their ability to provide this interactivity. 

## Solution

To create this interactivity, JavaScript is needed. It is possible to trigger CSS animations using JavaScript to achieve the interactive UI that modern users desire.
