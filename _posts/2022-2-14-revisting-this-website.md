As a part of General Assembly's Front-End Web Development 10-Week Course I have dusted off this old WIP to hopefully bring it closer to completion.
A lot of this stuff here is now deprecated but I'm going to give it a go.
There was plenty of stuff during the 10 week course that we went over and that I completed as well that I am eager to share.

Till next time!
